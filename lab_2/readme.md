# Protocols, socket creation, data transmisstion

### Opeing / Closing and writing into files 

- Low-level file IO
    * Linux based on a low-level file input and output, and Socket I/O can be 
      compared to file operations because the socket is also considered as a
      file (Generally, considered as stream)

    * File Descriptor (fd)
      * Operating system files are created (and socket) simply as numbers
        (to be able easily distinguish them)
      * Low-level file input and output function requires a file discriptor 
        for the perpose of making I/O operations.
      * Both socket & file have input and output stream 
        (socket being more advanced than file)
        socket discriptor can be used simply as a file discriptor as well  

- File open and close
